Hi there, I'm BAL KISHAN REDDY 👋

I'm an AI/ML Engineer focused on building and deploying applications with Generative AI. I am passionate about using large language models and RAG techniques to automate tasks, extract insights, and create intelligent, efficient workflows.

My professional work is focused on building, testing, and optimizing production-grade GenAI systems. My public repositories here contain my academic work and my personal explorations into new technologies.
